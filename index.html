        <p border="1" style="color:white">Hey! Welcome to my website. You may be wondering who is this man in the image. Well, this is J.Cole He's an American Rapper. Also, he's a big role model of mine. He carries himself properly. Not to mention, he is involved with current events and movements to make a difference. His music is not all about degrading women, sex, money, and drugs. Like other rappers, you see in this age. His music speaks on the truth of the black struggle while sending a positive message to his fans. Also, he likes to mix things up, where he will rap about anything. Personally, I really like the way he carries himself and how real of a person he is. If you want to hear some of his music than press on this <a style="color:white" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3wrVrwT80bC3dIj0HP3WsW?si=65gVYkubSka94Bc54NXLSg">[LINK].</a></p>
