        <p style="color:white">To be honest, I'm more of an inside person and, I like to spend my free time watching movies, anime and playing games. Honestly, for as far as I can remember, I have been a big nerd when it came to games. I still remember that my first type of console was a Gameboy. I was playing pokemon for hours on that, which, till this day I'm still a big gamer and, I'm definitely planning on getting that ps5. What can I say I'm a simple person. The simple things keep me happy.</p>
